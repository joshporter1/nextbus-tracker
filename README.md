# Nextbus Tracker

An app designed to map out SF buses using the Nextbus API.

### Getting Started
#### Requirements
* Python 2.7
* pip

#### Installation
1. Clone the repo. `git clone https://github.com/joshporter1/nextbus-tracker.git`
2. Enter the directory. `cd nextbus-tracker`
3. Install necessary packages. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the server. `python app.py`
5. Navigate to `localhost:5000` in a modern web browser.

### Future Enhancements

These are some features/functions that I would have liked to add or improve on if I had more time to polish the final product.

* Better UI for toggling routes
* Make it more mobile-friendly
* Better icons. Used circles for cleanliness, but actual bus icons would be nice (but clutters easily).
